                    <p>Captain Underpants has all the components of being a competent superhero origin story, but it succeeds because of the relationship between George and Harold. They're best friends who grew close to each other thanks to their similar comedic sensibilities, and who help keep the other one afloat through even the most troublesome of times. I went into Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie expecting a lot of things, but it being a legitimately heartwarming story about two friends who find joy in making each other laugh was not one of them.

It also doesn’t hurt the fact that Captain Underpants is one of the funniest movies to hit theaters so far this year. The screenplay by comedy veteran Nicholas Stoller is self-referential, lighthearted, and inventive, finding new ways to make often the same set of jokes work over and over again. Wisely, he makes sure all of the film’s comedy comes from the humanity of the characters, taking the time to establish and flesh out everyone in the film in a way that most animated movies these days don’t.

None of this is to say that Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie is perfect.</p>

                    <p>The Amazing World of Gumball is you know...AMAZING! That's why they put "Amazing" in the show's title so that it can make sense, am I right? I love the characters, a blue cat, a walking fish, a talking banana, a talking balloon, a walking peanut, and a bunch more cool and crazy stuff. Every time Gumball and Darwin scream, I always have to laugh because they scream like little girls. It was really funny in one episode when Gumball was crossdressing with his momma's wedding dress. I cracked up when I saw Gumball crossdress. Every time I'm bored, I always have to watch this show. If you're asking me what I wanna give this funny show, I give it a perfect 5/5</p>

While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Climate change: In what can be called a worrying disclosure, a study by scientists as US' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has revealed that between 2005 and 2019, the energy imbalance on Earth doubled. Basically, the energy balance on the Earth determines the climate of the planet, and this energy refers to the Sun's radiation. There is a delicate balance between the amount of Sun's radiation that the Earth's atmosphere absorbs and the thermal infrared radiation that the planet releases into space. If this balance decreases, the Earth can turn colder, while a positive change in the balance can heat up the Earth. And just like the concerns of experts over the past few decades, the imbalance has doubled in the 14-year period starting 2005, meaning that the Earth is heating up.
